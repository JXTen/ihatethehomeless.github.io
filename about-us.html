        <h2>Fuck homeless people</h2>
        <h4>Homeless people contribute nothing to society. They are lazy and useless. They just sit around all day and ask for money. If you're homeless, just buy a home idiot./h4>
	     <h2>We plan to kill all homeless people by the year 2025</h2>
	     <h4>By eliminating homeless people, we can solve the unemployment crisis, reduce overpopulation, and keep our streets clean!</h4>
	     
	     <h5>Help solve this crisis. Kill any homeless person you see on the streets!</h5>
